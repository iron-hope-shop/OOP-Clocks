### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The purpose of this project was to develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.  The problem it address was that to meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.

### What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did particularly well using modules which already existed to extend the functionality of my program.  For instance, _ctime_.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by adding asynchonous capabilities.  That was not a requirement of the initial project; however, I believe it would be beneficial to be able to see a ticking clock whilst modifying the time.  This is probably possible with _curses_.  Also, I could add role-based access via credentials or a token to ensure least privilege.

### Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the rendering of the clock challenging because I initially thought it had to be real-time.  I offset this confusion by going through the logic diagram and getting a better understanding of the logic.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I believe that the basic IO of this project as well as the use of headers will be a good reminder for me and a great starting point should I need to start another C++ project.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following comment standards and modulizing code.
